# Tower Notes

> 2025-FEB-13

I had some trouble getting the git repo to clone on the Tower via VS Code.
So... I copied the entire workspace to a removeable device and then to
the Tower.

This seems to have caused the issue to be resolved. We shall wee!

> Addendum

Did a pull request after the Lenovo's Pull and Sync. SUCCESS!

Looks like we're in business. Both workstations can now use the Lenovo branch.
Still need to figure out how to merge the branch back to main...
